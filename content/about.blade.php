    ## About Me

    Hello, Iâ€™m John. I am a **freelance PHP developer** and digital marketing specialist with over ten years of commercial experience in everything
    from brochure websites to eCommerce, Software as a Service (SaaS) online applications and small enterprise management systems. **I work remotely** from my studio in Taunton, UK.

    ### Previous examples of work

    I have been lucky enough to work with some great companies, from startups to scale-ups and even some larger SMBs. During that time I have built some pretty interesting web applications including:

    - A **crowdfunding platform** that processed over &pound;100 million in direct debit and credit card transactions in one year, providing growth-funding for over 300 small businesses throughout the UK.
    - An **online property rentals platform** that actively advertised and processed enquiries for up to 1500 properties a month. The same platform also provided end-to-end tenancy creation and management for thousands of landlords each year.
    - An **insurance quote engine** used by a group of companies to quote and provide cover for thousands of tradespeople around the UK, offering several insurance products and combining over 30 risk factors to provide a unique quote for every customer.
    - A **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform** that imported and aggregated pricing data for over 1 million used car sale prices each day, used to provide accurate vehicle pricing based on similar vehicles and price trends over time.
    - Consulted on and then implemented **improved developer workflows** for a UK growth-stage company, introducing local development builds, implementing continuous integration pipelines, and designed a **zero-downtime deployment platform** to ship code to staging and production environments.

    ### Technologies that I work with

    As a developer I mainly work in PHP with a particular passion for building web applications on the Laravel framework, although I also
    specialise in working on and modernising legacy PHP applications. Here are just some of the frameworks and technologies I use:

    - **PHP Applications**: [Laravel Framework](https://laravel.com/), [Symfony Framework](https://symfony.com/), [Yii Framework](https://www.yiiframework.com/), [CodeIgniter](https://codeigniter.com/)
    - **Frontend**: [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
    - **Other languages**: Node.js, Python, JavaScript
    - **Methodologies**: Microservices, Cloud Application Design Patterns, Twelve-Factor Apps, Event Sourcing, Message Queues

    ### What can I build for you?

    I am always looking for interesting projects to work on. I have worked with startups, scale-ups, and larger companies for both hands-on development and consulting roles. Here are some of the types of projects that I have a particularly good knowledge of:

    - **Re-architecting legacy PHP applications**: If you have an older PHP application (over 3 years) or a system that was previously built off-shore or by contractors, you may be considering your options for maintaining that system. I can help evaluate your current application and give guidance on how best to either maintain or re-write the system using modern PHP methodologies and best practices.
    - **Maintaining older applications**: Laravel and Symfony are the big names in town, but there are still loads of working CodeIgniter and Yii applications in the wild. It isn't easy finding a more experienced developer who understands how these frameworks were designed, I can help you.
    - **Scaling existing applications**: As traffic increases to your web application, you will eventually need more servers. With proper planning and re-working the application to support multi-server setups, I have adapted applications to run automatically and seamlessly scale to over 150 servers in a cloud-based configuration.
    - **Improved Developer Workflows**: You might already have a team in place, but you want to get a better handle on local development and deploying your code? I have built many development and deployment processes that allow you to reliably and confidently ship code without having to work late nights and weekends. I have worked in teams where we were able to ship to production with zero-downtime, enabling us to ship upwards of 30 code changes a day during working hours.

    With all projects, I take a **pragmatic and evidence-based approach**. I will work with the business to ensure the correct project is built at the correct time, to ensure the desired outcome. If I don't know what that correct path looks like, I will be up-front and honest, and do whatever I can to find someone who can help if required.
