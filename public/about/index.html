                    <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hello, Iâ€™m John. I am a <strong>freelance PHP developer</strong> and digital marketing specialist with over ten years of commercial experience in everything
from brochure websites to eCommerce, Software as a Service (SaaS) online applications and small enterprise management systems. <strong>I work remotely</strong> from my studio in Taunton, UK.</p>
<h3>Previous examples of work</h3>
<p>I have been lucky enough to work with some great companies, from startups to scale-ups and even some larger SMBs. During that time I have built some pretty interesting web applications including:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>crowdfunding platform</strong> that processed over &pound;100 million in direct debit and credit card transactions in one year, providing growth-funding for over 300 small businesses throughout the UK.</li>
<li>An <strong>online property rentals platform</strong> that actively advertised and processed enquiries for up to 1500 properties a month. The same platform also provided end-to-end tenancy creation and management for thousands of landlords each year.</li>
<li>An <strong>insurance quote engine</strong> used by a group of companies to quote and provide cover for thousands of tradespeople around the UK, offering several insurance products and combining over 30 risk factors to provide a unique quote for every customer.</li>
<li>A <strong>Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform</strong> that imported and aggregated pricing data for over 1 million used car sale prices each day, used to provide accurate vehicle pricing based on similar vehicles and price trends over time.</li>
<li>Consulted on and then implemented <strong>improved developer workflows</strong> for a UK growth-stage company, introducing local development builds, implementing continuous integration pipelines, and designed a <strong>zero-downtime deployment platform</strong> to ship code to staging and production environments.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technologies that I work with</h3>
<p>As a developer I mainly work in PHP with a particular passion for building web applications on the Laravel framework, although I also
specialise in working on and modernising legacy PHP applications. Here are just some of the frameworks and technologies I use:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PHP Applications</strong>: <a href="https://laravel.com/">Laravel Framework</a>, <a href="https://symfony.com/">Symfony Framework</a>, <a href="https://www.yiiframework.com/">Yii Framework</a>, <a href="https://codeigniter.com/">CodeIgniter</a></li>
<li><strong>Frontend</strong>: <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a>, <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a></li>
<li><strong>Other languages</strong>: Node.js, Python, JavaScript</li>
<li><strong>Methodologies</strong>: Microservices, Cloud Application Design Patterns, Twelve-Factor Apps, Event Sourcing, Message Queues</li>
</ul>
<h3>What can I build for you?</h3>
<p>I am always looking for interesting projects to work on. I have worked with startups, scale-ups, and larger companies for both hands-on development and consulting roles. Here are some of the types of projects that I have a particularly good knowledge of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Re-architecting legacy PHP applications</strong>: If you have an older PHP application (over 3 years) or a system that was previously built off-shore or by contractors, you may be considering your options for maintaining that system. I can help evaluate your current application and give guidance on how best to either maintain or re-write the system using modern PHP methodologies and best practices.</li>
<li><strong>Maintaining older applications</strong>: Laravel and Symfony are the big names in town, but there are still loads of working CodeIgniter and Yii applications in the wild. It isn't easy finding a more experienced developer who understands how these frameworks were designed, I can help you.</li>
<li><strong>Scaling existing applications</strong>: As traffic increases to your web application, you will eventually need more servers. With proper planning and re-working the application to support multi-server setups, I have adapted applications to run automatically and seamlessly scale to over 150 servers in a cloud-based configuration.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Developer Workflows</strong>: You might already have a team in place, but you want to get a better handle on local development and deploying your code? I have built many development and deployment processes that allow you to reliably and confidently ship code without having to work late nights and weekends. I have worked in teams where we were able to ship to production with zero-downtime, enabling us to ship upwards of 30 code changes a day during working hours.</li>
</ul>
<p>With all projects, I take a <strong>pragmatic and evidence-based approach</strong>. I will work with the business to ensure the correct project is built at the correct time, to ensure the desired outcome. If I don't know what that correct path looks like, I will be up-front and honest, and do whatever I can to find someone who can help if required.    </p>
<h3>Available to Hire</h3>
<p>I am currently available to hire for one-off projects and on-going contract work (1-5 days a week). I am a <strong>remote worker based in Taunton</strong>, Somerset working from my studio, although I am also able to attend on-site meetings as required (expenses paid). I would be more than happy to discuss any requirements you might have, so please give me a call or send an email to see what I can do for you.</p>
